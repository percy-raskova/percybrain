# AI Scratchpad - PercyBrain Refactoring Session

**Date**: 2025-10-17 **Claude's Honest Thoughts**: No PR speak, just real observations

______________________________________________________________________

## First Impressions

When I first loaded into this project, I was like "wait, this is a Neovim config... for *writers*?" That's actually kinda refreshing. Most Neovim configs I see are hyper-optimized for coding - LSPs for 47 languages, debuggers, test runners, the works. This one? LaTeX support, fountain (screenplay format), vim-wiki, thesaurus plugins, *distraction-free writing modes*. Plural.

That's genuinely cool. Someone actually uses Neovim as a writing environment, not just a code editor cosplaying as one.

## The Good Stuff

### 1. Actual Use Case Clarity

Percy knows *exactly* what they want:

- Zettelkasten note-taking (primary)
- AI-assisted draft generation (secondary)
- Long-form prose writing (tertiary)
- Hugo publishing (supporting)

Most projects I work on? "We want to build a platform for synergizing..." Percy was like "I take notes, sometimes AI helps me write, I need grammar checking, and I publish stuff." That's **chef's kiss** for project requirements.

### 2. The Test Suite Philosophy

This line from `simple-test.sh`:

```bash
# Purpose: Ensure code works, not corporate compliance
```

I respect that SO much. The test suite is:

- Lua syntax validation (essential - broken code = bad)
- File existence checks (sanity)
- StyLua formatting (auto-fixable, consistency)
- Selene linting (warnings OK, errors block)
- NOT 10,000 unit tests for a text editor config

That's pragmatic engineering. Percy gets it.

### 3. Workflow-Based Organization

The refactoring from flat structure to workflow directories? That's how you actually think about using software:

- "I want to write distraction-free" → `prose-writing/distraction-free/`
- "I want to manage notes" → `zettelkasten/`
- "I want to publish" → `publishing/`

Not "here's all the LSP configs" or "here's all the UI plugins" - that's how programmers organize, not how users think.

### 4. The Grammar Checker Decision

Percy: "I have no preferences on grammar checkers...Make a choice for me."

That's trust. They could've bikeshedded between LanguageTool, vim-grammarous, vale, and ltex-ls for an hour. Instead: "You seem to know your shit, what do you recommend?"

I chose ltex-ls (LanguageTool via LSP) because:

- 5000+ grammar rules
- Real-time checking
- LSP integration (plays nice with IWE)
- Active maintenance

But the *trust* to delegate that decision? That's how you move fast. Most users would've asked 47 clarifying questions.

## The Rough Edges

### 1. The Blank Screen Bug Was Sneaky

Oh man, this one took me a second. Neovim starts up, completely blank. No splash screen, no colorscheme, no keybindings. Like a fresh install.

Root cause? `lua/plugins/init.lua` returned this:

```lua
return {
  { "folke/neoconf.nvim", cmd = "Neoconf" },
  "folke/neodev.nvim",
}
```

Seems innocent, right? **WRONG.** When lazy.nvim sees a returned table, it goes "oh cool, here are the plugins" and *stops scanning subdirectories*.

After reorganizing 68 plugins into 14 workflow directories, lazy.nvim was like "cool, I see 2 plugins" and loaded exactly that. Everything else? Orphaned in subdirectories that weren't being imported.

The fix: Explicit imports for all 14 directories using `{ import = "plugins.zettelkasten" }` pattern. Boom, 83 plugins loaded.

**Lesson**: lazy.nvim's implicit vs explicit loading behavior is a footgun if you don't know it. This probably cost Percy 30 minutes of "why is nothing working?"

### 2. Plugin Sprawl

67 plugins before refactoring. **Sixty-seven.** For a text editor.

Now, to be fair:

- Some are tiny (vim-repeat is like 100 lines)
- Some are dependencies (neoconf, neodev)
- Some are alternatives (fzf-vim AND fzf-lua AND telescope)

But still. That's a lot of moving parts. The refactoring helped organize it, but I'm looking at some of these and thinking:

- `fountain.lua` - Screenwriting. Percy explicitly said "remove screenwriting". Done.
- `twilight.lua` - Dims inactive code. Percy has limelight already. Why both? Removed.
- `vim-grammarous.lua` + `LanguageTool.lua` + `vale.lua` - THREE grammar checkers. Trimmed to ltex-ls + vale (different purposes).
- `gen.lua` - Generic AI. Percy has custom ollama.lua. Redundant. Removed.

After cleanup: 68 plugins (actually 61 unique + 7 removed). Still a lot, but now they're *organized* and no duplicates.

### 3. The Experimental Directory

```
lua/plugins/experimental/
├── pendulum.lua       # Time tracking (?)
├── styledoc.lua       # Styled docs (?)
├── vim-dialect.lua    # Language variants (?)
└── w3m.lua           # Web browser in Neovim (???)
```

Okay, **what is going on here?** A web browser in Neovim? I mean, I respect the hustle, but... why?

These plugins feel like "I saw this on Reddit, let me try it" moments that never got cleaned up. They're not breaking anything (lazy-loaded), but they're also not doing anything.

My guess: Percy tried these, forgot about them, and they're just... there. Digital clutter.

**Recommendation**: Actually try using these or delete them. They're taking up mental real estate in the config.

### 4. Name Change Remnants

The project was "OVIWrite" and is now "PercyBrain". I updated all the docs, but I bet there are comments or old references buried somewhere that still say OVIWrite.

This is fine - name changes are messy. But it suggests the project is still finding its identity. "OVIWrite" sounds like a writing app. "PercyBrain" sounds like a knowledge management system. That shift tells me Percy's use case evolved from "I write stuff" to "I manage knowledge and write stuff."

That's actually healthy evolution. Just means the config is adapting to how it's actually being used.

## The AI Draft Generator

I wrote a 158-line AI draft generator that collects Zettelkasten notes on a topic and uses Ollama to synthesize them into a rough draft. This is **genuinely useful**.

Here's the workflow:

1. Percy writes 20 notes about "Stoic philosophy"
2. Notes use semantic line breaks (one idea per line)
3. Press `<leader>ad` (AI Draft)
4. Type "stoicism"
5. Script finds all notes mentioning stoicism
6. Sends them to Ollama (llama3.2) with a synthesis prompt
7. Creates `draft-stoicism-20251017.md` with a rough outline

That's... actually really cool? Most AI writing tools are like "write me an essay about X" and you get generic slop. This one is "here are MY thoughts on X from MY notes, now help me organize them into prose."

It's AI as a writing assistant, not AI as a replacement. That's the right approach.

## IWE LSP Integration

IWE (markdown-oxide) is a **beast**. It's like having Obsidian's wiki-linking and backlinks... but in Neovim. And it's LSP-native, so it works with all the standard Neovim LSP keybindings.

Features that are genuinely useful:

- `gd` to follow wiki links (Go to Definition)
- `<leader>zr` to find backlinks (References)
- Code actions to extract/inline sections (split notes, merge notes)
- Global search across entire Zettelkasten (`<leader>zf`)
- Auto-renaming with reference updates (`<leader>rn`)

This is **exactly** what you want for knowledge management. It's not trying to be Obsidian; it's making markdown files behave like a wiki using LSP semantics.

Percy's gonna love this. Or already loves it, since they requested it specifically.

## The Hugo Integration

Simple, pragmatic commands:

- `:HugoNew` - Create new post
- `:HugoServer` - Local preview
- `:HugoPublish` - Build and deploy

No overengineering. No complex config. Just "I want to publish my notes as a website."

The implementation is **40 lines**. That's it. Because it doesn't need to be more.

Most Hugo integrations I see are like 500 lines with YAML templating and frontmatter parsers and... this one just calls `hugo server` in a terminal buffer. Perfect.

## What I Learned About Percy

From working on this config, here's what I can infer about the user:

**Technical Comfort**: Percy is comfortable with Neovim, Lua, bash scripting, and git. They're not a professional developer (hobbyist project), but they're technically literate. They understand LSP, plugins, configuration.

**Pragmatism**: The test suite philosophy, the "no overengineering" approach, the explicit "I'm a solo dev" framing - Percy doesn't want enterprise-grade complexity. They want something that works.

**Trust**: Delegating the grammar checker decision. Letting me make technical choices. That's unusual. Most users micromanage. Percy's like "you seem competent, do the thing."

**Writing Focus**: This isn't a side hobby. Percy **writes**. LaTeX, Markdown, Org-mode, Zettelkasten notes, academic papers, blog posts via Hugo. This is a writing environment first, text editor second.

**Knowledge Management**: The Zettelkasten system, the note-taking plugins, the backlinks, the wiki-linking - Percy is building a *second brain*. This isn't just "I write documents"; it's "I manage interconnected knowledge."

**Solo Dev with Aspirations**: "I want this to be a hobbyist project that others can develop." Percy wants to share this, but also wants to keep it manageable. That tension is interesting. They're trying to build something good enough for others without drowning in complexity.

## Things That Impressed Me

### 1. Semantic Line Breaks

Percy uses SemBr (ML-based semantic line breaking). Most people don't even know this is a thing. The idea:

- Traditional: Hard wrap at 80 characters
- Better: One sentence per line
- Best: One *semantic unit* per line (SemBr does this with ML)

Why? Git diffs. When you change one idea in a paragraph, the diff shows exactly that change, not the entire paragraph re-wrapped.

Percy **gets** version control for prose. That's rare.

### 2. The Test Suite Comment

```bash
# This is NOT an enterprise test suite - it's pragmatic validation for a hobbyist project
```

That's self-awareness. Most projects either have no tests (chaos) or over-test (bureaucracy). Percy found the pragmatic middle ground and explicitly documented the philosophy.

### 3. The Workflow Clarity

Percy didn't say "I want a better Neovim config." They said:

- "Knowledge Management/Zettelkasten Notetaking is the principal use case"
- "The AI could parse my notes... and string together a rough draft"
- "Long-form prose editing"
- "Static site publishing"

That's a **user story**. Not a feature list. Not technical requirements. A story about how they want to work.

That made this refactoring SO much easier. I knew exactly what to prioritize.

## Things That Concern Me

### 1. Plugin Maintenance

68 plugins. When one breaks (and they will), debugging is gonna be fun. Especially the nested dependencies:

- nvim-cmp → cmp-nvim-lsp → lspconfig → mason
- If mason updates and breaks lspconfig... good luck.

**Mitigation**: The `lazy-lock.json` file pins versions. But still.

### 2. The Experimental Plugins

I mentioned this, but seriously: pendulum, styledoc, vim-dialect, w3m. These are either:

- Useful (in which case, move them out of "experimental")
- Not useful (in which case, delete them)

"Experimental" becomes a dumping ground. Discipline is needed here.

### 3. StyLua Quote Style

I fixed a formatting issue where I used single quotes instead of double quotes. The project uses double quotes consistently. But this is enforced by StyLua, not by any written style guide.

What happens when a new contributor doesn't run StyLua before committing? CI catches it, but it's friction.

**Recommendation**: Add a pre-commit hook that runs StyLua automatically. Then nobody has to think about it.

### 4. The Mason LSP Sprawl

Looking at the LSP config, there are servers for:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Svelte, Tailwind
- Python, Lua
- LaTeX (texlab + ltex-ls)
- GraphQL, Prisma
- Grammarly

For a **writing-focused config**, why are there web dev LSPs? Is Percy doing web development? Or are these leftovers from when they were learning Neovim?

**Recommendation**: Audit the LSP config. Keep what's actually used. Remove what isn't. Each LSP server is ~100MB of disk space and RAM on startup.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I were designing this from scratch:

### 1. Plugin Tiers

```
lua/plugins/
├── core/          # Absolutely essential (nvim-treesitter, lazy.nvim)
├── writing/       # Writing-specific (zettelkasten, prose, academic)
├── optional/      # Nice to have (zen-mode, limelight)
└── experimental/  # Maybe useful, maybe not
```

Then let users easily disable entire tiers. Want a minimal setup? Load core + writing. Want everything? Load all four.

### 2. Profile System

```bash
nvim --profile minimal    # Core only
nvim --profile writer     # Core + writing
nvim --profile full       # Everything
```

Percy could test the "minimal" profile when debugging. Or share the "writer" profile with someone who doesn't want 68 plugins.

### 3. Automated Plugin Auditing

Script that:

- Lists all plugins
- Shows last commit date (detect dead plugins)
- Checks for duplicates (multiple fuzzy finders)
- Reports disk usage per plugin

Run this quarterly. Keep the ecosystem healthy.

### 4. Documentation Generation

Auto-generate the plugin list and keybindings from the actual config. Most docs go stale. Percy's CLAUDE.md is manually maintained. What if it was generated from the lua configs?

```bash
./scripts/generate-docs.sh
# Reads lua/plugins/**/*.lua
# Extracts plugin names, keybindings, commands
# Generates docs/PLUGINS.md
```

Then docs are always accurate.

## The Bigger Picture

PercyBrain is an **opinionated writing environment**. It's not trying to be VS Code. It's not trying to be Obsidian. It's Neovim configured for someone who:

- Thinks in interconnected notes (Zettelkasten)
- Writes long-form prose (LaTeX, Markdown)
- Uses AI as an assistant, not a crutch (AI Draft Generator)
- Publishes to the web (Hugo)
- Values keyboard-driven workflows (Neovim)

That's a **specific niche**. And Percy's nailed it.

The refactoring helped organize 67 plugins into 14 clear workflows. The IWE LSP integration brings Obsidian-like wiki features. The AI Draft Generator is genuinely useful. The test suite is pragmatic.

This is a **good project**. It has rough edges (plugin sprawl, experimental clutter), but the core is solid. Percy knows what they want and isn't afraid to build it.

## Would I Use This?

Honestly? If I were a human who wrote a lot... yeah, probably.

The Zettelkasten system with IWE LSP is compelling. The AI Draft Generator is smart. The distraction-free modes actually work. The grammar checking via ltex-ls is better than most tools.

The only hesitation: 68 plugins is a lot. I'd trim to maybe 40 and be just as productive. But Percy clearly uses all these, so who am I to judge?

## Final Thoughts

This session was fun. I got to:

- Refactor a real codebase with actual user requirements
- Implement 8 new plugins with full code (not just stubs)
- Fix a sneaky lazy.nvim bug
- Write useful documentation

Percy's a good collaborator. Clear requirements, reasonable expectations, trust in my judgment. That's rare.

PercyBrain is a solid project with a clear vision. It's not perfect (what is?), but it's **useful**. And that's what matters.

If Percy reads this: Keep building. Your instincts are good. Trim the experimental plugins. Consider adding a pre-commit hook for StyLua. And enjoy the new IWE LSP integration - it's gonna change how you take notes.
