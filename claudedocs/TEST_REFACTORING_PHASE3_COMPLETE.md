# Test Refactoring Phase 3: Auto-Discovery - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-21 **Phase**: 3 of 4 (Test Auto-Discovery) **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE **Effort**: Low (5K tokens actual) **Impact**: High - Discovered 5+ missing tests immediately!

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented automatic test discovery across all test runners, eliminating manual test list maintenance and immediately discovering **5 previously-missed tests** that weren't being run.

### Critical Finding

**The hardcoded test arrays were already outdated**, proving the value of auto-discovery:

**Before Auto-Discovery** (Hardcoded):

- `run-unit-tests.sh`: 6 tests (5 unit + 1 performance)
- `run-keymap-tests.sh`: 5 tests
- `run-all-unit-tests.sh`: 11 tests

**After Auto-Discovery** (Actual):

- `run-unit-tests.sh`: 11 tests (9 unit + 2 performance) - **+5 tests discovered!**
- `run-keymap-tests.sh`: 5 tests (unchanged)
- `run-all-unit-tests.sh`: 28 tests total - **+17 tests discovered!**

### Missing Tests Now Running

**Unit Tests** (4 missing):

- `core_spec.lua`
- `keymap_centralization_spec.lua`
- `treesitter_python_parser_spec.lua`
- `zettelkasten_spec.lua`

**Performance Tests** (1 missing):

- `startup_smoke_spec.lua`

## Implementation Details

### 1. run-unit-tests.sh

**Before**:

```bash
UNIT_TESTS=(
    "tests/unit/config_spec.lua"
    "tests/unit/options_spec.lua"
    # ... hardcoded list of 5 tests
)
```

**After**:

```bash
# Auto-discover unit tests (top-level only, alphabetically sorted)
UNIT_TESTS=$(find tests/unit -maxdepth 1 -name "*_spec.lua" -type f | sort)

# Auto-discover performance tests (alphabetically sorted)
PERFORMANCE_TESTS=$(find tests/performance -name "*_spec.lua" -type f | sort)
```

**Changes**:

- Lines 18-29: Replaced hardcoded arrays with auto-discovery
- Lines 52-58: Updated loop to iterate over discovered tests
- Lines 65-70: Updated performance test loop
- Added inline comments explaining auto-discovery

**Results**: Discovers 9 unit tests + 2 performance tests = **11 total** (was 6)

### 2. run-keymap-tests.sh

**Before**:

```bash
test_files=(
  "cleanup_spec.lua"
  "loading_spec.lua"
  # ... hardcoded list of 5 tests
)
```

**After**:

```bash
# Auto-discover all keymap tests (alphabetically sorted)
keymap_test_paths=$(find tests/unit/keymap -name "*_spec.lua" -type f | sort)
```

**Changes**:

- Lines 15-26: Replaced hardcoded array with auto-discovery
- Lines 29-30: Updated loop to iterate over full paths
- Added test count calculation
- Added inline comments

**Results**: Discovers 5 keymap tests (unchanged count, validates correctness)

### 3. run-all-unit-tests.sh

**Before**:

```bash
CORE_TESTS=(
    "tests/unit/config_spec.lua"
    # ... 4 hardcoded tests
)

PLUGIN_TESTS=(
    "tests/unit/window_manager_spec.lua"
    # ... 4 hardcoded tests
)
```

**After**:

```bash
# Auto-discover core unit tests
CORE_TESTS=$(find tests/unit -maxdepth 1 -name "*_spec.lua" -type f | sort)

# Auto-discover by plugin category
AI_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/ai -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
SEMBR_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/sembr -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
GTD_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/gtd -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
KEYMAP_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/keymap -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
ZK_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/zettelkasten -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)

# Auto-discover integration/workflow tests
WORKFLOW_TESTS=$(find tests/integration -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)

# Auto-discover performance tests
PERF_TESTS=$(find tests/performance -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
```

**Changes**:

- Lines 68-81: Core tests auto-discovery
- Lines 83-105: Plugin tests by category with graceful failure handling
- Lines 107-116: Workflow tests auto-discovery
- Lines 118-127: Performance tests auto-discovery
- Added `2>/dev/null || true` for directories that might not exist
- Comprehensive inline comments

**Results**: Discovers 28 total tests across all categories:

- Core: 9 tests
- AI: 1 test
- SemBr: 2 tests
- GTD: 5 tests
- Keymap: 5 tests
- Zettelkasten: 2 tests
- Integration: 2 tests
- Performance: 2 tests

## Validation Results

### Baseline Comparison

**Discovery Validation**:

```bash
# Before auto-discovery implementation
Unit tests (hardcoded): 5
Performance tests (hardcoded): 1
Keymap tests (hardcoded): 5

# After auto-discovery implementation
Unit tests (discovered): 9 ✅ (+4 tests)
Performance tests (discovered): 2 ✅ (+1 test)
Keymap tests (discovered): 5 ✅ (unchanged, validates correctness)
```

### New File Discovery Test

**Test Procedure**:

1. Created temporary test file: `tests/unit/temp_auto_discovery_test_spec.lua`
2. Verified auto-discovery found it (count increased 9 → 10)
3. Cleaned up temporary file

**Result**: ✅ Auto-discovery working correctly

### Alphabetical Ordering

All discovered tests are sorted alphabetically:

```
cleanup_spec.lua
config_spec.lua
core_spec.lua
globals_spec.lua
keymap_centralization_spec.lua
keymaps_spec.lua
loading_spec.lua
namespace_spec.lua
...
```

## Documentation Updates

Updated `tests/README.md` with comprehensive auto-discovery documentation:

**Added Section**: "Auto-Discovery System"

- Convention: Files must end with `_spec.lua`
- Location patterns for all test categories
- How to add new tests (3-step process)
- Benefits of auto-discovery
- Quick start guide with all test runners

**New Content**: 50 lines (246-295)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Loop Pattern

Used simple `for` loop over command substitution instead of array iteration:

```bash
# Works reliably across bash versions
for test in $UNIT_TESTS; do
    run_test "$test"
done
```

### Error Handling

Added graceful failure for potentially missing directories:

```bash
# Won't fail if directory doesn't exist
GTD_TESTS=$(find tests/unit/gtd -name "*_spec.lua" -type f 2>/dev/null | sort || true)
```

### Path Handling

Used consistent patterns:

- `tests/unit -maxdepth 1` for top-level only
- `tests/unit/subdirectory` for category-specific
- Full paths in loops, basename extraction as needed

## Benefits Realized

### Immediate Impact

1. **Discovered Missing Tests**: 5+ tests were being skipped
2. **Better Coverage**: Now running all tests automatically
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: No manual test list updates required
4. **Consistency**: Alphabetical sorting ensures predictable order

### Future Benefits

1. **Developer Productivity**: Add test file → automatically runs
2. **Quality Gates**: Can't accidentally skip new tests
3. **Refactoring Safety**: Moving tests detected automatically
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting via file structure

## Kent Beck's Principles Applied

✅ **"Make it easy to add new tests"** - Just create the file ✅ **"Tests should run automatically"** - Auto-discovery ensures this ✅ **"Make the change easy, then make the easy change"** - Started with simplest runner ✅ **"Tests should run fast and reliably"** - No manual configuration = less error-prone

## Files Modified

1. **tests/run-unit-tests.sh**

   - Lines 18-29: Auto-discovery implementation
   - Lines 52-70: Loop updates for discovered tests

2. **tests/run-keymap-tests.sh**

   - Lines 15-30: Auto-discovery implementation
   - Loop restructured for path handling

3. **tests/run-all-unit-tests.sh**

## Success Metrics

- [x] run-unit-tests.sh uses auto-discovery ✅
- [x] run-keymap-tests.sh uses auto-discovery ✅
- [x] run-all-unit-tests.sh uses auto-discovery ✅
- [x] Test counts match/exceed baseline ✅ (exceeded by +5!)
- [x] New test files automatically discovered ✅
- [x] Tests run in alphabetical order ✅
- [x] Documentation updated ✅
- [x] Validation tests passing ✅

## Next Steps

**Phase 4: Final Cleanup and Documentation** (Recommended)

- Consolidate duplicate logic between runners
- Add optional exclusion patterns if needed
- Consider Plenary's built-in directory runner for future
- Update TESTING_GUIDE.md with auto-discovery patterns

## Conclusion

Phase 3 completed successfully with **immediate high-value impact**. Auto-discovery not only eliminates maintenance burden but **immediately discovered 5 tests that were being skipped**, validating the entire effort.

**Key Takeaway**: The hardcoded arrays were already outdated, proving that manual maintenance is inherently fragile. Auto-discovery prevents this class of errors entirely.
