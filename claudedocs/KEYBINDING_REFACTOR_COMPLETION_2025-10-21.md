## Detailed Changes

### Phase 1.1: Zettelkasten Consolidation

#### IWE Navigation (from `g*` to `<leader>z*`)

| Old  | New          | Reason                    |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `gf` | `<leader>zF` | Consolidation (capital F) |
| `gs` | `<leader>zS` | Consolidation             |
| `ga` | `<leader>zA` | Consolidation             |
| `g/` | `<leader>z/` | Consolidation             |
| `gb` | `<leader>zB` | Consolidation (capital B) |
| `go` | `<leader>zO` | Consolidation             |

**Impact**: Writers no longer need to remember separate `g*` prefix for IWE navigation. All note operations in ONE namespace.

#### IWE Refactoring (from `<leader>i*` to `<leader>zr*`)

| Old          | New           | Reason                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `<leader>ih` | `<leader>zrh` | Refactoring sub-namespace |
| `<leader>il` | `<leader>zrl` | Refactoring sub-namespace |

**Impact**: Refactoring notes is a Zettelkasten operation, now properly namespaced.

#### Quick Capture (from `<leader>q*` to `<leader>z*`)

| Old          | New          | Reason                    |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `<leader>qc` | `<leader>zq` | Consolidation (q = quick) |

**Impact**: Quick capture feeds inbox - belongs with Zettelkasten operations.

### Phase 1.2: Prose Namespace Expansion

#### New Writer-Focused Keybindings (8 additions)

| Keybinding    | Function            | Category                 |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `<leader>pr`  | Reading mode        | NEW - Focus              |
| `<leader>pw`  | Word count stats    | NEW - Writing            |
| `<leader>ps`  | Toggle spell check  | NEW - Writing            |
| `<leader>pg`  | Start grammar check | NEW - Writing            |
| `<leader>pts` | Timer start         | MOVED from `<leader>ops` |
| `<leader>pte` | Timer stop          | MOVED from `<leader>ope` |
| `<leader>ptt` | Timer status        | MOVED from `<leader>opt` |
| `<leader>ptr` | Timer report        | MOVED from `<leader>opr` |

#### Renamed Keybindings (clarity improvements)

| Old          | New          | Reason                     |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `<leader>p`  | `<leader>pp` | Clarity (double p)         |
| `<leader>pd` | `<leader>pf` | Mnemonic (f = focus)       |
| `<leader>pp` | `<leader>pP` | Avoid conflict (capital P) |

**Impact**: Writers have comprehensive prose tools in one namespace: focus modes, word counts, spell/grammar checking, time tracking.

### Phase 1.3: Git Simplification

#### Removed Operations (11 keybindings)

**Use LazyGit GUI (`<leader>gg`) instead:**

- `<leader>gd` - Git diff split
- `<leader>gL` - Git log (capital L)
- `<leader>gdo` - Diffview open
- `<leader>gdc` - Diffview close
- `<leader>gdh` - File history
- `<leader>gdf` - Full history
- `<leader>ghr` - Reset hunk
- `<leader>ghb` - Blame line

#### Kept Essential Operations (11 keybindings)

**Primary Interface:**

- `<leader>gg` - LazyGit GUI

**Essential Operations (5):**

- `<leader>gs` - Git status
- `<leader>gc` - Git commit
- `<leader>gp` - Git push
- `<leader>gb` - Git blame
- `<leader>gl` - Git log

**Hunk Operations (5):**

- `<leader>ghp` - Preview hunk
- `<leader>ghs` - Stage hunk
- `<leader>ghu` - Undo stage
- `]c` - Next hunk
- `[c` - Previous hunk

**Impact**: Writers use LazyGit for complex operations. Keybindings cover only frequently-used essentials.

______________________________________________________________________

## Breaking Changes Summary

### High Impact (muscle memory adjustment required)

1. **IWE Navigation**: `gf`, `gs`, `ga`, `g/`, `gb`, `go` → `<leader>z[F|S|A|/|B|O]`

   - **Mitigation**: Capital letters distinctive, all in one discoverable namespace

2. **Quick Capture**: `<leader>qc` → `<leader>zq`

   - **Mitigation**: Logical consolidation, q mnemonic (quick) preserved

3. **Focus Mode**: `<leader>pd` → `<leader>pf`

   - **Mitigation**: Better mnemonic (f = focus)

4. **Time Tracking**: `<leader>op*` → `<leader>pt*`

   - **Mitigation**: Writers track time while writing, prose namespace more logical

### Medium Impact (less frequent operations)

1. **IWE Refactoring**: `<leader>i[h|l]` → `<leader>zr[h|l]`

   - **Mitigation**: Refactor sub-namespace, logical grouping

2. **Diffview Operations**: Removed (use LazyGit GUI)

   - **Mitigation**: `<leader>gg` provides visual interface for all diff operations

3. **Paste Image**: `<leader>pp` → `<leader>pP`

   - **Mitigation**: Capital P to avoid conflict with prose mode

4. **Prose Mode**: `<leader>p` → `<leader>pp`

   - **Mitigation**: Double p for clarity, prose namespace remains same

### Low Impact (additions, not replacements)

1. **Reading Mode**: `<leader>pr` (NEW)
2. **Word Count**: `<leader>pw` (NEW)
3. **Spell Check**: `<leader>ps` (NEW)
4. **Grammar Check**: `<leader>pg` (NEW)

______________________________________________________________________

## Design Rationale

### Writer-First Philosophy

**Before**: Keybindings optimized for developers

- Git operations: 20+ keybindings (developer-heavy)
- Prose tools: 4 keybindings (minimal writer support)
- Zettelkasten: Scattered across 4 namespaces (cognitive overhead)

**After**: Keybindings optimized for writers

- Git operations: 11 essential keybindings (use GUI for advanced)
- Prose tools: 12 keybindings (comprehensive writer support)
- Zettelkasten: Unified in ONE namespace (cognitive efficiency)

### Cognitive Load Reduction

**Problem**: Writers had to remember:

- `<leader>z*` for core Zettelkasten
- `g*` for IWE navigation
- `<leader>i*` for IWE refactoring
- `<leader>q*` for quick capture

**Solution**: ONE namespace for ALL Zettelkasten operations

- `<leader>z*` for everything note-related
- Capital letters for IWE navigation (distinctive)
- `<leader>zr*` sub-namespace for refactoring
- `<leader>zq` for quick capture

**Result**: Writers only need to remember ONE prefix for knowledge management.

### Frequency-Based Allocation

**High Frequency Operations** (now easy to access):

- Zettelkasten: All under `<leader>z*` (discoverable via Which-Key)
- Prose: Expanded tools under `<leader>p*` (writing-focused)
- Git: Essential operations only (use GUI for rest)

**Low Frequency Operations** (delegated to GUI):

- Git diffview: Use LazyGit visual interface
- Advanced hunks: Use LazyGit
- Complex merges: Use LazyGit

______________________________________________________________________

## Validation Results

### Script Execution

```bash
$ lua scripts/validate-keybindings.lua
✅ Zettelkasten consolidated under <leader>z*
✅ Prose expanded with writer tools (<leader>p*)
✅ Git simplified to essentials (<leader>g*)
✅ IWE preview kept separate (<leader>ip*)
✅ Time tracking moved to prose namespace
✅ Quick capture consolidated to zettelkasten
```

### Expected Totals

- Zettelkasten: 23+ keybindings
- Prose: 12 keybindings
- Git: 11 keybindings
- IWE Preview: 4 keybindings
- AI: 8 keybindings (unchanged)
- Other: ~80 keybindings (telescope, navigation, etc.)
- **Total**: ~138 custom keybindings
