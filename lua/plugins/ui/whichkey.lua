-- Plugin: which-key
-- Purpose: Interactive keybinding popup showing available commands after leader key
-- Workflow: ui
-- Why: Critical for ADHD users - eliminates need to memorize keybindings. Shows available options
--      contextually after <leader> or other prefix keys. Reduces decision paralysis by presenting
--      organized choices. Learning aid for new users. Categorized groups (Find/File, Zettelkasten,
--      AI, etc.) provide mental scaffolding. 500ms delay balances discoverability with not
--      interrupting flow for experienced users.
-- Config: minimal - delay timing and leader key group labels
--
-- Usage:
--   Automatic: Press <leader> and wait 500ms - popup shows available commands
--   Navigate: Use displayed keys to complete command
--   Organized groups:
--     <leader>f - Find/File operations (Telescope)
--     <leader>z - Zettelkasten workflows (notes, links, AI)
--     <leader>a - AI assistant commands
--     <leader>t - Translate/Terminal
--     <leader>w - Window management
--
-- Dependencies: none (pure Neovim plugin)
--
-- Configuration Notes:
--   - delay = 500: Half-second wait before popup (balance discoverability vs interruption)
--   - Groups defined via wk.add() for organized categorization
--   - Separator "→" shows relationship between key and command
--   - VeryLazy loading: Doesn't slow down startup
