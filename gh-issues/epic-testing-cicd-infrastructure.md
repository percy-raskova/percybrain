# Epic: Complete Testing & CI/CD Infrastructure (Phases 2-5)

**Labels:** `infrastructure`, `ci-cd`, `high-priority`, `testing`, `epic`

## Description

Implement the remaining four phases of the testing/CI/CD migration plan to enable automated validation, contributor workflows, and documentation synchronization.

## Context

- Phase 1 partially complete (validation scripts exist)
- Phases 2-5 entirely unimplemented
- Detailed roadmap in `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (archived to Zettelkasten)

## Value

- Automated quality gates prevent regressions
- Contributor-friendly local development workflow
- Matrix testing across platforms/versions
- Automated documentation drift detection
- Reduced maintainer overhead

## Tasks

- [ ] #5: Implement CI/CD Phase 2 - Local Development Workflow
- [ ] #6: Implement CI/CD Phase 3 - CI Enhancement & Matrix Testing
- [ ] #7: Implement CI/CD Phase 4 - Documentation Sync Automation
- [ ] #8: Implement CI/CD Phase 5 - Refinement & Monitoring

## Estimated Effort

- Phase 2: 12-16 hours (git hooks, setup scripts, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Phase 3: 16-20 hours (CI workflows, matrix testing, optimization)
- Phase 4: 8-12 hours (doc validation, extraction, sync)
- Phase 5: Ongoing (monitoring and iteration)
- **Total: 36-48 hours initial + ongoing**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Contributors can set up dev environment in \<5 minutes
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits automatically
- [ ] CI runs matrix testing across Neovim 0.8+, 0.9+, 0.10+
- [ ] Documentation drift detected automatically
- [ ] PR review time reduced by 50% (automated validation)
- [ ] Contributor onboarding friction reduced significantly

## Dependencies

- GitHub Actions runners
- Neovim versions: 0.8.0, 0.9.0, 0.10.0+
- Test infrastructure (Plenary, Busted)
