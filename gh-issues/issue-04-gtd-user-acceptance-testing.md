# Issue #4: GTD User Acceptance Testing

**Parent Epic:** Complete GTD Workflow Implementation

**Labels:** `testing`, `gtd`, `user-acceptance`, `documentation`

## Description

Conduct user acceptance testing for GTD system with real workflows and iterate on AI suggestion quality based on feedback.

## Requirements

1. Define UAT test scenarios covering all GTD phases
2. Recruit beta testers (internal + external users)
3. Conduct structured testing sessions
4. Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback
5. Iterate on AI prompts based on feedback
6. Document best practices and common workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] UAT test plan with 10+ scenarios covering full GTD workflow
- [ ] Beta testing with 3-5 users (minimum 2 weeks)
- [ ] Feedback survey completed by all testers
- [ ] AI prompt iterations based on user feedback (target: 80%+ satisfaction)
- [ ] Bug fixes for issues identified during UAT
- [ ] User guide updated with real-world workflow examples
- [ ] Video walkthrough or screencast of GTD workflow

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Onboarding

- User starts with empty GTD system
- Capture 10 tasks from various sources
- Clarify and organize tasks
- Complete first weekly review

### Scenario 2: AI-Assisted Task Management

- User captures vague task
- AI decomposes into subtasks
- AI suggests contexts and priorities
- User validates AI suggestions

### Scenario 3: Weekly Review Workflow

- User has 50+ tasks across all lists
- Complete weekly review with AI assistance
- Measure time saved vs manual review

### Scenario 4: Context-Based Task Selection

- User switches contexts (@home â†’ @work)
- System shows relevant tasks only
- User completes tasks and tracks time

### Scenario 5: Long-Term Usage

- User tracks tasks for 30 days
- Analytics show completion trends
- User reviews and adjusts system

## Feedback Collection

- Pre-UAT: Baseline expectations survey
- During UAT: Session observations and notes
- Post-UAT: Satisfaction survey (1-5 scale)
- Metrics: Task completion rate, AI accuracy, time saved

## Iteration Plan

1. **Week 1-2**: Initial UAT with feedback collection
2. **Week 3**: Prompt refinement and bug fixes
3. **Week 4**: Second UAT round with improvements
4. **Week 5**: Final documentation and polish

## Estimated Effort

4-6 hours (iterative feedback and improvements)
