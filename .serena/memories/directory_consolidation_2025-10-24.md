# Directory Consolidation: lua/percybrain/ → lua/lib/

**Date**: 2025-10-24 **Decision**: Option 2 (Rename) vs Option 1 (Full Restructure) **Rationale**: User requested "whatever is simplest, works, and doesn't break a bunch of shit"

## Changes

- Renamed `lua/percybrain/` → `lua/lib/` (14 files + gtd/ subdirectory)
- Updated 179 require statements across lua/ and tests/
- Fixed 7 @module documentation comments
- Updated 17 package.loaded references
- Fixed GTD AI test mock to handle Lua colon syntax (`Job:new()`)

## Architecture Pattern

```
lua/plugins/     = lazy.nvim plugin specs (declarative)
lua/lib/         = internal utility modules (imperative)
lua/config/      = configuration (setup and options)
```

## Test Results

- GTD AI: 25/25 passing ✅ (was 16/25 failing - fixed 9 tests)
- Ollama Manager: 14/14 passing ✅
- Regression: 13/13 passing ✅

## Why Rename vs Restructure?

- Separation of concerns is proven pattern
- 100+ require statements made full restructure too risky (2-4 hours)
- Rename achieved clarity in 15 minutes with low risk
- Name "percybrain" was confusing - "lib" clearly indicates internal utilities
