# Session: Directory Consolidation & Quartz Migration

**Date**: 2025-10-24 **Duration**: ~2 hours **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary

Completed two major refactoring tasks:

1. Directory consolidation: `lua/percybrain/` → `lua/lib/`
2. Test migration: Hugo frontmatter → Quartz v4 specification

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Rename vs Restructure

**User input**: "I am personally in favor of doing whatever is simplest, and works, and doesn't break a bunch of shit"

**Options**:

- Option 1: Full consolidation into `lua/plugins/` (high risk, 2-4 hours)
- Option 2: Rename to `lua/lib/` (low risk, 15 minutes) ✅ SELECTED
- Option 3: Keep current structure (no clarity improvement)

**Outcome**: Chose simplicity - achieved clarity without breaking risk

### Decision 2: Hugo Test Adaptation

**User request**: "Review the Quartz documentation, and keep the spirit of the Hugo tests while adapting them to the Quartz framework"

**Approach**: Created new Quartz-specific module and tests, preserved validation spirit

## Results

- ✅ Directory: 179 require statements updated, all tests passing
- ✅ Quartz: 18/18 new tests passing
- ✅ GTD AI: Fixed 9 broken tests (25/25 passing)
- ✅ Documentation: Updated user-level CLAUDE.md with Serena memory guidance

## Files Created

- `lua/lib/quartz-frontmatter.lua` - Validation module
- `tests/contract/quartz_frontmatter_spec.lua` - Test suite
- Serena memories: `directory_consolidation_2025-10-24`, `quartz_test_migration_2025-10-24`

## Files Deprecated

- `tests/contract/hugo_frontmatter_spec.lua` → `.deprecated`

## Lessons Learned

1. Simple > Complex: Renaming was 10x faster than restructuring
2. User input matters: Pausing to ask saved 2 hours of risky work
3. Spec-driven testing: Quartz v4 docs clearly defined requirements
4. Spirit over letter: Test migration isn't just find-replace
5. Documentation strategy: Session notes → Serena memories, not claudedocs/
