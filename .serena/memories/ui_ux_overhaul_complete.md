# PercyBrain UI/UX Overhaul Complete - 2025-10-18

## Major Achievements
1. **Blood Moon Theme**: Successfully implemented tokyonight-based Blood Moon colorscheme
2. **Privacy Protection**: Comprehensive register clearing system for sensitive data
3. **AI Testing Framework**: Complete AIDEV protocol with hands-on environment validation
4. **Error Logging**: Native Neovim-based error viewing system
5. **Keybinding Resolution**: Fixed all WhichKey conflicts with window manager

## Key Discoveries
- MCP cannot interact with interactive UI elements (WhichKey, Telescope, etc.)
- Neovim registers were storing sensitive data (SSH keys, API configs) - now protected
- nightfox.lua was overriding colorscheme with priority 999
- Window manager keybindings were conflicting with WhichKey

## Files Created
- lua/config/privacy.lua - Privacy protection system
- lua/percybrain/error-logger.lua - Error logging utilities
- lua/percybrain/ai-tester.lua - AI testing suite
- AI_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md - AIDEV protocol specification
- MCP_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md - Connection troubleshooting
- scripts/start-nvim-mcp.sh - MCP server startup script

## Next Steps
- Monitor error logger for any remaining issues
- Expand AI testing suite with more comprehensive tests
- Consider implementing automated testing on config changes
