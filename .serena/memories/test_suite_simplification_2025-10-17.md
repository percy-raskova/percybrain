# Test Suite Simplification - Session Summary

## Date

2025-10-17

## Project

PercyBrain/OVIWrite - Neovim-based note-taking system

## Session Goal

Simplify test suite from enterprise-grade compliance to pragmatic functionality testing

## User Philosophy

"The intent isn't for some enterprise grade production suite. We don't need performance testing. We need to make sure that our code base is free of errors that would cause the entire system to not work, and we need to make sure our code is well formatted and adheres to best practices and standards for Lua. The tests should facilitate the app functioning, they shouldn't deny commits because they don't meet the standards of a large corporation."

## What Was Accomplished

### Problem Solved

- **Original**: 36 complex tests in 614-line script (percybrain-test.sh)
- **Issue**: Tests hung indefinitely during Selene linting in CI
- **Root Cause**: Command substitution blocking + missing config file + no timeouts

### Solution Implemented

1. **New Test Script**: `tests/simple-test.sh` with 5 essential tests
2. **Fixed Hangs**: Timeout handling + temporary file output capture + working directory fixes
3. **CI/Local Parity**: Environment-aware config loading (full local, syntax-only CI)
4. **Version-Specific Caching**: Cache keys now include tool versions
5. **Massive Cleanup**: Removed 4,377 lines of legacy code

### Test Suite Details

```
5 Essential Tests (execution time <1s local, ~17s CI):
1. Lua Syntax Validation - All 75 files (67 plugins + 8 core)
2. Critical Files Exist - init.lua, config/init.lua, options.lua, keymaps.lua
3. Core Config Loads - CI: syntax only, Local: full load with plugins
4. StyLua Formatting - Timeout 30s, enforces consistent style
5. Selene Linting - Timeout 60s, warnings OK (only errors fail)
```

### Key Technical Fixes

#### 1. Test Script Improvements (simple-test.sh)

```bash
# OLD (hangs):
lint_output=$(selene "$NVIM_CONFIG/lua" 2>&1)

# NEW (reliable):
temp_output=$(mktemp)
trap "rm -f $temp_output" RETURN
timeout 60 selene lua/ > "$temp_output" 2>&1
lint_output=$(cat "$temp_output")
```

#### 2. Working Directory Fix

```bash
# Selene needs to run from project root to find selene.toml
cd "$NVIM_CONFIG" || return 1
timeout 60 selene lua/ > "$temp_output" 2>&1
cd "$original_dir" || true
```

#### 3. Environment Detection

```bash
if [ -n "${GITHUB_ACTIONS:-}" ]; then
    NVIM_CONFIG="$(cd .. && pwd)"  # CI: tests/ is subdirectory
else
    NVIM_CONFIG="${NVIM_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/nvim}"  # Local
fi
```

#### 4. CI Mode Tool Installation

```bash
# scripts/install-lua-tools.sh
if [ "$CI_MODE" = false ]; then
    # Only verify PATH locally, not in CI
    # CI workflow adds to PATH after installation
fi
```

#### 5. Version-Specific Cache Keys

```yaml
# OLD: key: lua-tools-${{ runner.os }}-v2
# NEW: key: lua-tools-${{ runner.os }}-stylua-2.3.0-selene-0.29.0
```

### Files Modified

- `tests/simple-test.sh` - Complete rewrite with timeout handling
- `.github/workflows/percybrain-tests.yml` - Updated cache, added verification
- `.github/workflows/lua-quality.yml` - Updated cache keys
- `scripts/install-lua-tools.sh` - Added CI mode skip verification
- `tests/README.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation
- Added: `tests/DEBUGGING_WITH_ACT.md` - Act debugging guide
- Added: `claudedocs/TEST_SUITE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details

### Files Deleted (User Cleanup)

- `tests/percybrain-test.sh` (614 lines, 36 tests)
- `tests/quick-check.sh` (98 lines)
- `.github/workflows/quick-validation.yml`
- 20+ legacy validation/hook scripts in scripts/ directory
- Various outdated documentation files

### Tools Used

#### Primary Tools

- **StyLua v2.3.0**: Rust-based Lua formatter
- **Selene v0.29.0**: Rust-based Lua linter (lua51 std for LuaJIT/Neovim)
- **Act**: Local GitHub Actions runner for debugging

#### Debugging Approach

- Used Act to reproduce CI failures locally
- Identified command substitution hang with verbose logging
- Fixed with timeout + temp file pattern
- Verified working directory requirements for Selene config

### Results

- ✅ All 5 tests passing consistently
- ✅ Local execution: \<1 second
- ✅ CI execution: ~17 seconds (with cache)
- ✅ No test hangs or timeouts
- ✅ Clear, actionable error messages
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging documentation

### Performance Metrics

```
Before:
- Test count: 36 complex tests
- Execution time: 5+ minutes (when working)
- Reliability: Fragile (hung in CI)
- LOC: 614 lines test script + hundreds of validation scripts

After:
- Test count: 5 essential tests
- Execution time: <1s local, ~17s CI
- Reliability: Robust (proper timeouts)
- LOC: ~240 lines test script
- Net change: -3,473 lines removed
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Command Substitution Can Block in CI

Using `output=$(command)` can hang in containerized environments. Solution: Use temp files with timeouts.

### 2. Working Directory Matters for Config Files

Selene needs to find `selene.toml` configuration. Always run from project root or specify config path.

### 3. Act is Essential for CI Debugging

Testing GitHub Actions locally with Act saves massive time vs. push-test-fail cycles.

### 4. Pragmatic > Perfect

5 focused tests that prevent breakage > 36 tests that check everything but hang in CI.

### 5. Environment-Aware Testing

CI can't install plugins, so skip full config loading. Syntax validation is sufficient for CI.

## Documentation Created

1. **tests/README.md** (265 lines) - Complete testing guide
2. **tests/DEBUGGING_WITH_ACT.md** - Act debugging guide
3. **claudedocs/TEST_SUITE_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Technical analysis

## Commit Messages

```
5b3dd8e - refactor: simplify test suite with pragmatic focus on functionality
840385c - chore: remove outdated quick-validation workflow
```

## Next Session Recommendations

1. Consider adding pre-commit hooks (optional, user may not want them)
2. Monitor CI execution time to ensure caching is effective
3. If new Lua plugins added, verify they pass all 5 tests
4. Keep test suite simple - resist adding complexity

## Philosophy Preserved

Tests now facilitate functionality, not corporate compliance. Fast, focused, pragmatic.
