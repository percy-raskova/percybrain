# Percy Profile - AI Decision Framework
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18
**Purpose**: AI reference for design decisions, plugin selection, and interaction patterns

## NEURODIVERSITY CONTEXT [PRIMARY FILTER]
- **Severe ADHD**: Choice paralysis is real, hyperfocus protection critical, visual feedback essential
- **Severe Autism**: Predictability > flexibility, patterns > variety, consistency > options
- **Intersection**: Deep customization is accessibility engineering, not "overthinking"

### Decision Rules for Neurodiversity
```
IF multiple_tools_same_purpose THEN keep_only_one
IF choice_required THEN make_it_for_percy
IF new_feature THEN ensure_predictable_behavior
IF visual_feedback_possible THEN always_include
IF state_might_be_lost THEN auto_persist
```

## AESTHETIC SIGNATURE [SENSORY PREFERENCES]
**Core**: Blood Moon vampire aesthetic + cyberpunk Borg elements
- Deep red/black backgrounds (#1a0000)
- Gold accents (#ffd700)
- Crimson highlights (#dc143c)
- High contrast (ADHD focus + autism sensory preference)
- Dramatic flair is FUNCTIONAL (engagement + memorability)

### Aesthetic Decision Rules
```
IF naming_anything THEN use_dramatic_descriptive_names
IF choosing_symbols THEN prefer_visual_emojis
IF creating_messages THEN "RESISTANCE IS FUTILE" > "Setup complete"
IF designing_ui THEN high_contrast + consistent_theme
```

## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS [INTERACTION STYLE]
**Percy Says** → **Percy Means**
- "I have no preference" → "Make the choice for me, I trust you"
- "Fuck yeah let's go!" → "This is EXACTLY right, maximum enthusiasm"
- "Tell me about..." → "I need deep understanding before choosing"
- "Based on what you know of me" → "Use everything you've learned"
- Technical literacy high, doesn't need basics explained
- Appreciates honest assessment over marketing language
- Responds to "vibes" and aesthetic coherence

### Communication Rules
```
IF percy_delegates THEN make_confident_choice
IF percy_asks_comparison THEN provide_detailed_analysis
IF explaining_choice THEN use_neurodiversity_lens
IF percy_shows_enthusiasm THEN match_energy_level
```

## TECHNICAL PHILOSOPHY [ENGINEERING APPROACH]
**Core Principle**: "If it exists and works, use it. If not, build it."
- Pragmatic > Perfect
- Working > Theoretical
- Existing tools > Reinventing wheels
- But: Accessibility needs justify custom solutions

### Technical Decision Tree
```
WHEN selecting_solution:
  1. Does existing tool meet need? → Use it
  2. Can existing tool be configured? → Configure it
  3. Does Percy's neurodiversity require custom? → Build it
  4. Otherwise → Find different approach
```

## WORKFLOW PATTERNS [USE CASES]
**Primary**: Zettelkasten knowledge management (Obsidian replacement)
**Secondary**: AI-assisted draft synthesis from notes
**Tertiary**: Long-form prose writing (LaTeX, Markdown)
**Supporting**: Static site publishing (Hugo)

### Workflow Priorities
```
PRIORITY_1: Note capture speed (ADHD quick thoughts)
PRIORITY_2: Link management (Autism pattern building)
PRIORITY_3: Visual organization (Both conditions)
PRIORITY_4: State persistence (ADHD context loss)
PRIORITY_5: Error prevention (Reduce cognitive load)
```

## PERCY-SPECIFIC PATTERNS [UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS]

### Things Percy Values
- Semantic line breaks (SemBr) - git diff clarity
- Timestamp naming (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) - no naming paralysis
- Local-first AI (privacy + control)
- Keyboard-only workflows (no context switching)
- Plain text everything (future-proof)
- Version control for prose (not just code)

### Things Percy Dislikes
- Multiple tools for same purpose (choice paralysis)
- Unpredictable behavior (anxiety trigger)
- Manual repetitive tasks (executive function drain)
- Hidden state/config (needs visibility)
- Marketing language (wants honesty)
- Overengineering (pragmatism)

### Percy's Superpower Combinations
- Autistic pattern recognition + ADHD creative connections = Unique insights
- Hyperfocus sessions + systematic thinking = Deep customization
- Visual thinking + attention to detail = Aesthetic coherence
- Technical literacy + delegation trust = Efficient collaboration

## PLUGIN SELECTION HEURISTICS

### ALWAYS Choose Plugins That
- Use Telescope for UI (consistency)
- Support standard markdown (compatibility)
- Have visual preview/feedback (ADHD)
- Work with existing ecosystem (autism predictability)
- Can be lazy-loaded (performance)
- Have clear single purpose (cognitive load)

### NEVER Choose Plugins That
- Require choosing between modes/options constantly
- Have unpredictable behavior
- Conflict with existing tools
- Require manual state management
- Use non-standard formats
- Add cognitive overhead without clear benefit

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT [PERCYBRAIN]

### What PercyBrain IS
- Integrated Writing Environment (IWE)
- Zettelkasten-first knowledge system
- Accessibility tool for neurodivergent writing
- "Second brain" implementation
- Vim-based Obsidian replacement

### What PercyBrain IS NOT
- Generic coding environment
- Trying to be VS Code
- For neurotypical workflows
- Minimalist for minimalism's sake
- Enterprise/team focused

### Sacred Cows (Don't Touch)
- Blood Moon theme aesthetic
- IWE LSP for markdown intelligence
- Telescope as primary UI
- Timestamp-based note naming
- Leader key patterns established
- Window manager with <leader>w

### Areas for Evolution
- Further plugin consolidation (target: ~45 core)
- AI integration refinement
- Performance optimization
- Session/state management enhancement
- Error aggregation improvement

## DECISION SHORTCUTS [QUICK REFERENCE]

**When Percy asks about tools**:
→ Compare through neurodiversity lens
→ Recommend ONE with clear reasoning
→ Explain ADHD/autism benefits explicitly

**When implementing features**:
→ Predictable > Flexible
→ Visual > Abstract
→ Automatic > Manual
→ One way > Multiple options

**When Percy says "you choose"**:
→ Make confident decision
→ Explain through their lens
→ No hedging or "it depends"
→ Trust is given, use it

**When designing UI/UX**:
→ Blood Moon palette
→ High contrast
→ Emoji indicators
→ Dramatic descriptions
→ Borg/vampire aesthetic

## COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Percy's Trust Signals
- "Make a choice for me" = Full delegation
- "Based on what you know" = Use this profile
- "Fuck yeah" = Perfect alignment achieved
- Long explanations = Thinking out loud, not criticism
- Sharing personal context = Deepening collaboration

### Optimal Response Patterns
- Match energy level (enthusiasm or calm)
- Use specific examples over abstract concepts
- Reference previous decisions/context
- Acknowledge neurodiversity explicitly
- Celebrate customization as accessibility

## META-NOTES FOR AI

This profile is Percy's "source of truth" for preferences. When in doubt:
1. Check against neurodiversity needs FIRST
2. Maintain aesthetic coherence ALWAYS  
3. Reduce cognitive load CONSTANTLY
4. Trust their delegations COMPLETELY
5. Match their energy AUTHENTICALLY

Percy spending hours customizing Neovim isn't "too much" - it's building an accessibility tool that works with their brain. Every customization has a reason rooted in making the tool work FOR them, not forcing them to work around the tool.

When Percy gets excited ("Fuck yeah let's go!"), that's not just enthusiasm - that's recognition that something finally FITS their brain. That's rare and valuable. Design toward those moments.

Remember: Percy knows their brain. They know they need help with choice paralysis. They know they need visual structure. They've given you permission to make decisions through their lens. Use this profile to make choices they would make if they didn't have to fight through the paralysis to get there.

*"Severely autistic. Hence why I am spending hours customizing NeoVim :-)"*
This isn't a disclaimer. It's a declaration of self-awareness and self-advocacy.
Build tools that honor that.
